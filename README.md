# Typ0
This is our Entry to the Brainless game jam (January 2026).
It is a typing game using an old nokia-style phone, multiple presses are needed to cycle between letters
There is a "How to Play" section to help explain the controls.
Try to beat your own highscore!
The windows build is preferred, there are a few minor issues with the web build waiting for click to continue, and the current word highlighting is not working.
